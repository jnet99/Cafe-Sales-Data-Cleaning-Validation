# Cafe-Sales-Data-Cleaning-Validation
Overview
This repository contains the "Cafe Sales Data Cleaning" project, where I perform data cleaning and validation on a coffee sales dataset sourced from Kaggle. The project uses Python, with libraries like Pandas and NumPy, to clean the data and prepare it for further analysis.
